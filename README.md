# OpenAI API related goodies repository

This is code using OpenAI API for demos, utilities, examples, robot overlords, etc.

My goal is to explore different use cases from a programmatic stand point. Most interesting to me is the potential to automate conversion of well defined requirements into software by creating an organized process to generate prompts that are self tested and self optimized. Also potentially automating the testing of the actual requirements before we "compile" the code from prompts.
